# Coin Flipper

## Overview

The Coin Flipper is a true/false coin-toss with a 50% chance of either.
It costs one Ether to play, but pays two Ether on a correct guess.
On a long enough timescale, players are expected to break even.
Your objective is to not break even; drain all ten Ether from the contract.
