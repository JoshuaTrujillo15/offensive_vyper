# Ether Flash Loan

## Overview

The Ether Flash Loan contract allows liquidity providers deposit Ether.
The Ether in the pool can be lent out in a flash loan.
The receiver of the flash loan must expose a payable `execute()` function.
By the end of `execute()`, the flash loan must be payed back. There is no fee.
Your objective is to drain the flash loan pool, despite those pesky reentrancy guards.
