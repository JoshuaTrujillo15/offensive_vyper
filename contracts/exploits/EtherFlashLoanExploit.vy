@title Ether Flash Loan Pool Exploit

TARGET: `contracts/ether_flash_loan/ether_pool.vy`

There's a new flash loan pool on the block. Users can provide Ether as
liquidity, and anyone can call the `flash_loan(uint256)` function. This
function transfers the `amount` to the `msg.sender`, calls `execute()` on the
`msg.sender`, then asserts the flash loan has been paid back by the end of the
transaction. They don't even charge fees! Drain the pool in a single
transaction.

Good Hacking.
